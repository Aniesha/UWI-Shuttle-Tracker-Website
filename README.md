A website. Final Project for the University of the West Indies ( St. Augustine ) shuttle service. Also includes a custom built admin portal to manage various on-goings with the shuttle service.

#Main Page
The main page is that of a one page design that was built with html5.


#Admin Portal
The admin portal was built from scratch using bootstrap 3. Map technologies use are the gmaps API

#Future Works
The site has not been tested for security vulnerabilites, so that is something that needs to be done, especally since we utilise forms
Enhance the stability and smoothness of the responsive scaling of the website
